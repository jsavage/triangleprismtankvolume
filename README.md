Calculating the volume of a fuel tank in the shape of a triangle prism
# Fuel Volume vs Measured Depth in a Triangular Prism Fuel Tank

This notebook demonstrates the relationship between the **measured depth from the top** of a triangular prism fuel tank and the **remaining fuel volume**, assuming:

- Full volume = 100 litres
- Height of tank cross section = H (normalized to 1)
- Depth *h* measured from the top (`h=0` full, `h=H` empty)
- Volume fraction = \((1 - \frac{h}{H})^2\)
